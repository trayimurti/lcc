Like trees in general, spanning trees are connected and acyclic. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of its edge weights. For example, Fig. 35 shows a graph and one of its spanning tree. The weight of this spanning tree is $3 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 2 = 22.$","permalink":"/lcc/docs/graph-algorithms/mst/intro"},{"id":"graph-algorithms/mst/kruskal","title":"Kruskal\'s Algorithm","description":"Kruskal\u2019s algorithm builds a minimum spanning tree by greedily adding edges to the graph. The initial spanning tree only contains the nodes of the graph and does not contain any edges. Then the algorithm goes through the edges ordered by their weights and always adds an edge to the graph if it does not create a cycle.","permalink":"/lcc/docs/graph-algorithms/mst/kruskal"}],"allTagsPath":"/lcc/docs/tags"}')}}]);
