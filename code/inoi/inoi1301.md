# Calvins Game, INOI 2013

## Problem Description

Question : [Calvins Game, INOI 2013](https://www.codechef.com/INOIPRAC/problems/INOI1301) 

Submit Code : [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/INOIPRAC/submit/INOI1301)

## Prerequisites

[Dynamic Programming : 1D](https://trayimurti.github.io/lcc/docs/intro)

## Solution

This problem can be broken into smaller sub-problems. We would have to create two 1D for applying DP. One array (`points1[x]`) will store maximum points made while making backward phase from square `x` to square `1`, and another (`points2[y]`, where $y \ge k$) will store maximum points made while making forward phase from square `k` to square `y`. So, for  every $y \ge k$ we will have points made $= points1[y] + points2[y] - square[y]$. Then we will take maximum of those points which will be our answer. 

For example, for `n = 5`, `k = 2` , and `square[] = {5, 3, -2, 1, 1}`

if Calvin make forward move from 2 to 4 and backward phase from 4 to 1 then for forward phase we have `points2[4]` and backward phase we have `points1[4]`. So, total points will be $points1[4] + points2[4] - square[4]$ 


## Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;
	vector<int> squares(n+1);
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		cin >> squares[i];

	vector<int> points1(n+1);
	points1[1] = squares[1];
	points1[2] = squares[1] + squares[2];
	for(int i=3;i<=n;i++)
		points1[i] = squares[i] + max(points1[i-1], points1[i-2]);

	vector<int> points2(n+1);
	points2[k] = 0;
	points2[k-1] = 0;
	for(int i=k+1;i<=n;i++)
		points2[i] = squares[i] + max(points2[i-1], points2[i-2]);

	int ans = points1[k] + points2[k] - squares[k];
	for(int i=k+1;i<=n;i++)
		ans = max(ans, points1[i] + points2[i] - squares[i]);
	cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
