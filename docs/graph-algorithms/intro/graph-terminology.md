# Graph Terminology

:::info
In this course we will use variable `n` as number of nodes and variable `m` as number of edges.
The nodes will be numbered using integers 1, 2, ..., n.

Fig. 1 shows a graph example with 5 nodes and 7 edges.

## Length of a path

The length of a path is the number of edges in it. For example, Fig. 2 shows a path
$1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5$ of length 3 from node 1 to node 5.

## Cycle in a graph

A cycle is a path where the first and last node is the same. For example, Fig. 3 shows a cycle $1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 1$.

## Connected graph

A graph is connected if there is a path between any two nodes. In Fig. 4, the left graph is connected, but the right graph is not connected, because it is not possible to get from node 4 to any other node.

The connected parts of a graph are called its components. For example, the graph in Fig. 5 has three components: {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, and {8}.

## Tree

A tree is a connected graph that does not contain cycles. Figure 6 shows an example of a graph that is a tree.

## Directed graph

In a directed graph, the edges can be traversed in one direction only. Figure 7 shows an example of a directed graph. This graph contains a path $3 \to 1 \to 2 \to 5$ from node 3 to node 5, but there is no path from node 5 to node 3.

## Weighted graph

In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths, and the length of a path is the sum of its edge weights. For example, the graph in Fig. 8 is weighted, and the length of the path $1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5$ is $1 + 7 + 3 = 11$. This is the shortest path from node 1 to node 5.

## Neighbors or adjacent nodes

Two nodes are neighbors or adjacent if there is an edge between them.

## Degree of a node

The degree of a node is the number of its neighbors. Figure 9 shows the degree of each node of a graph. For example, the degree of node 2 is 3, because its neighbors are 1, 4, and 5.

The sum of degrees in a graph is always 2m, where m is the number of edges,
because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one. For this reason,
the sum of degrees is always even.

## Regular graph

A graph is regular if the degree of every node is a constant d.

## Complete graph

A graph is complete if the degree of every node is n âˆ’ 1, i.e., the graph contains all possible edges between the nodes.

## Indegree and Outdegree

In a directed graph, the indegree of a node is the number of edges that end at the node, and the outdegree of a node is the number of edges that start at the node. Figure 10 shows the indegree and outdegree of each node of a graph. For example, node 2 has indegree 2 and outdegree 1.

## Bipartite graph

A graph is bipartite if it is possible to color its nodes using two colors in such a way that no adjacent nodes have the same color. It turns out that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not have a cycle with an odd number of edges. For example, Fig. 11 shows a bipartite graph and its coloring.
